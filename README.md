### **II. Organizational Background**
China Green Foundation(CGF) was established in [year] to promote environmental sustainability and improve living conditions in China’s rural areas. We have successfully implemented several community development projects in partnership with local governments and international NGOs. Our expertise lies in renewable energy, environmental education, and community empowerment.

**Mission Statement:**  
To promote sustainable development in China through green energy solutions and community-based environmental initiatives.

---

### **III. Problem Statement**
Rural China continues to face challenges related to energy access, with many communities relying on coal and other non-renewable sources for power. This dependence exacerbates environmental degradation and threatens public health. Lack of access to affordable and clean energy hinders rural development and increases inequality between urban and rural regions.

China has set a national agenda to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions. However, rural areas often lack the necessary infrastructure, resources, and knowledge to transition to renewable energy. This project seeks to address these gaps.

### **IV. Project Objectives**
1. **Increase Access to Renewable Energy:**  
   Install solar power systems in 20 rural villages, providing clean energy to at least 10,000 residents.

2. **Promote Environmental Education:**  
   Conduct training sessions for local community members on the benefits of renewable energy and sustainable living practices.

3. **Build Local Capacity:**  
   Train local technicians to maintain and repair solar systems, ensuring long-term sustainability of the project.

4. **Enhance Economic Development:**  
   Support local businesses and agricultural operations in transitioning to renewable energy, leading to cost savings and economic growth.
